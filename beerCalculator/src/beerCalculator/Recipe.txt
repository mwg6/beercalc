Heat 2.761875 gallons of water to strike (149-169 Faranheit
Add the [asas, as, a]to the pot and steep for two hours, checking occasionally to ensure water temp is still in strike range
If water is too cold add a quart of boiling water to the mash and stir.
While the grains are steeping heat a further 4.1428125 of water to strike.
At the end of two hours of steeping flush the mash water slowly (<1 quart aminute) from the mash tun
You will need to do this 6-7 times, until the liquid becomes clear and no longer foggy. Gently pour the flushed water back on top of the grain bed in a gentle, circular motion.
When the water is clear, begin flushing the mash tun at the same slow rate of <1quart a minute into a large vessel for boiling
As a quart is drained into the pot, replace it with the water heated to strike, again using a gentle circular motion to pour the water and not disturb the grain bed.
Boil the liquid down to 4 gallons
Remember to add your [asa]to the beer! Add sixty minutes before boiled down to 4for a more bitter, IPA-like flavor profile and 10-15 minutes before for more aromatics
Cool the liquid to 80 degress faranheit once it has reached 4 and put in your primary fermentation vessel
Pitch the yeast, give a stir with a clean utensil, and let ferment for two wweks before bottling
